## Arduino Magnetic Log Collector

Any Arduino has amazing logging capabilities, figure out the cheapest way of collecting them

What if they built a damn and breed crayfish near to a network of 220a/c volts arduino devices and the crayfish
learnt how to collect the logs like if they were salts in the hidrogen gas and accumulated them in the negative current of the cloud based servers and everything suddenly updates all the Hives and MongoDBs ...

## Lottery Divinator Magic Remote Radio Controlled Car

The Path of electronics is to research how to make your magic car.

First 3d Model the chassis and  make a 3d simulation of the entire plans
with all the features to test in the UNREAL.

Then Bake the Breads , print the model , make a rest request to the lottery number divination service you wrote before with a DB of winning lottery numbers since your Birthdate, so you can get and statisticlly generated coefficient product to dip with whatever equation you came after listening Ozzy singing Dreamer.

The model will print received on a tft screen and then will blink a led the times of the wining number in an increasing beat, so your memory speed acts a resistor to your lucky 555 chip.
The Model can only be used once and needs to happen a sunday before the lottery games that happen on a Sunday 13th , but if you sent your the exact distance multiplied by the delta Time of the model exact velocity, it can be used any Sunday. BE AWARE if the wolf of the Good Sheriff of the County dislikes you , wont work for you.

Using a cord attached to the model to keep the distance as a constan is NOT allowed, this rule was added by the wolf, because the gravity of the operator affects the model delta time and the wolf reserves the right of not telling why is disliking you.
