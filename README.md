## Lottery Divinator Magic RC Car

The Path of electronics is to research how to make your magic car.

First 3d Model the chassis and  make a 3d simulation of the entire plans
with all the features to test in the UNREAL.

Then Bake the Breads , print the model , make a rest request to the lottery number divination service you wrote before.

The model will print received on a tft screen and then will blink a led the times of the wining number in an increasing beat, so your memory speed acts a resistor to your lucky 555 chip.
The Model can only be used once and needs to happen a sunday before the lottery games that happen on a Sunday 13th , but if you sent your the exact distance multiplied by the delta Time of the model exact velocity, it can be used any Sunday. BE AWARE if the wolf of the Good Sheriff of the County dislikes you , wont work for you.

This Project will pay the cost of a presential MIT major At MIT Computing School.
